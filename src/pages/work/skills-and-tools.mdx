I started my career as a web developer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2019} years ago**adn since then, I've been playing with multiple technologies in both the front-end and back-end.

Even though the scope of web development is broad, I was very interested and focused on **Front-End Development** and **UI/UX Design**.

## Full-stack Developer

I love creating web apps that not only look great, but also function flawlessly. The process of taking an idea from concept to finished product is exhilarating, and I find great satisfaction in seeing my work come to life.

I really enjoy creating websites with **rich UI components**, including:

- **Web application**,
- **Creative landing page**,
- **CMS contents layout**,
- **Dashboard layout**,
- and others.

But I still like to make simple website pages like **simple landing pages**. So, what tools did I feel comfortable using during the website creation?

### TypeScript

I recently started using TypeScript as I became more involved in back-end development, and it has been a huge time and life-saver. I can't recommend it enough.

### React

I really enjoy building single page applications and websites and React is my go-to library.

I've been using it **since 2020 ({new Date().getFullYear() - 2020} years)** and have become quite proficient with it.

### Tailwind CSS

TailwindCSS has made styling my components that much easier; it's definitely a go-to.

### Framer Motion

For animations, I am more comfortable using Framer Motion. Creating animations using JavaScript has **never been as easy as using Framer Motion**.

### Next.js

I've been using CRA for a few years, but since discovering Next.js, I don't think I would want to use any other web framework. **It's just that good!**

### Prisma

I recently started using Prisma and haven't looked back when it comes out to database manupilation.

## UI/UX Designer

I've been Designing user interfaces **for {new Date().getFullYear() - 2019} years now**.

My main focus is on creating an exceptional user experience while also developing visually appealing user interfaces. It's a delicate balancing act, and I'm always thinking about how to achieve the perfect combination of both elements.

One of the biggest challenges I face is finding the sweet spot between a stunning UI and a seamless UX. While a visually appealing interface can draw users in, a smooth and intuitive experience is what keeps them engaged.

## Detail and Summary

I represent all data in labels to make it easier to read. The **underline indicator** shows how often I used the related item, e.g.:
