We built a simple and efficient invoice management system for the handyman. The app allows the handyman to create invoices, send them to their clients via email, track payments, send reminders, and manage their business on the go. The app is portable and can be used on any device with a web browser and as for mobile it is so smooth that it looks like a native app.
