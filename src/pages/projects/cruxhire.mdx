**cruxHire** is an AI-powered platform designed for recruiters to streamline every step of the hiring process using intelligent agents and intuitive workflows like kanban boards.

## About the Project

We built **cruxHire** from scratch with the mission to modernize and automate recruitment workflows. Tailored for today's recruitment teams, the platform helps manage candidates efficiently, eliminate manual tasks, and provide AI-driven insights that accelerate decision-making.

At the heart of cruxHire is a smart AI agent that can analyze resumes, rank candidates, and assist with candidate outreach—all seamlessly integrated into the recruiter’s daily workflow.

## Key Challenges

Before cruxHire, most tools lacked:

- Support for multiple tenants or client organizations
- Real-time data pipelines and resume parsing capabilities
- Fine-grained role and permission management
- Rich automations or integrations with third-party tools like ATS or job boards

We set out to build an enterprise-ready hiring platform from the ground up, with scalability, modularity, and user experience at its core.
