**LamehAi** is a cutting-edge data intelligence platform that empowers some of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent capital funds—including Sedco Capital, Alpha Capital, and several others—to make data-driven decisions at scale. Designed to ingest, process, and analyze massive datasets in real-time, Lamehai acts as a strategic backbone for investment intelligence.

## About the Project

I serve as the **Head of Product** at Lamehai, where I lead the strategic development and evolution of the platform. My role spans from product vision and roadmap planning to overseeing the engineering and design teams to ensure successful execution and delivery.

## The Challenge

When I first joined Lamehai, the platform was in its infancy—an MVP with limited functionality and infrastructure that struggled to scale. Key challenges included:

- Lack of multi-tenant architecture
- No real-time data ingestion or processing pipelines
- Basic role management and analytics
- Minimal integration with third-party services and data providers

The task was clear: transform the MVP into a robust, enterprise-grade product that could support multiple clients and handle vast amounts of data securely and reliably.

## Design and Development

We redesigned the platform from the ground up, focusing on scalability, performance, and user experience. This involved both front-end and back-end architectural improvements, as well as robust cloud infrastructure.

**Key Features Introduced**:
- Multi-tenant user management system
- Real-time analytics dashboards
- Modular data pipelines
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Seamless data ingestion from third-party APIs and Excel reports
- Scalable microservice-based architecture

**Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js, FastAPI  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Services, Azure, Docker  
- **Messaging & Pipelines**: Google Pub/Sub  
- **DevOps**: GitHub Actions, Docker, Cloud Build  

This robust stack allowed us to deliver a high-performance, low-latency platform tailored to the unique needs of financial institutions.
